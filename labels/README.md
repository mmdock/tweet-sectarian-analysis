### Labeling

This directory is for managing the hand labeling of training data.

run `gather_tweets.py` to gather tweets into a `raw_tweets.txt` file

run `label.py` so your labelers can hand label raw tweets.

Note: Doesn't handle duplicates

Note: The split capabilities was setup so we could each attempt labeling 500 at a time

How to improve: WAY more raw tweets needed.  Run the `gather_tweets.py` more
